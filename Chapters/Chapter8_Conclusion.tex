\caption[Miami University]{The Miami University Logo. Use long figure captions that completely describe your figure. Tell me what you want me to notice, explain how I should interpret the results. I should understand the figure without reading the text. Layout your figure so there is no ``vacuum" of empty space. Consider grouping related graphics into one figure.  Also, always label your figures and notice that the caption is below the figure. Use the optional argument to caption to provide a short version in the list of figures. }
