\chapter{Another Paper Goes Here}
Only include this chapter if you are very productive and you are able to get two different papers ready for publication. It may be the case that you collaborate with another student, and togother you are able to produce multiple papers. In that case, you will need to determine if you have the right to use that paper in the thesis.   If it is decided that you include a paper that was co-authored by another student, I would like to see an author-contribution statement as an appendix. In it, you should describe your specific contributions to the chapter and come to an agreement with yor co-authors that it is accurate.
